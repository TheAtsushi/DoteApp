# DoteApp
It's a simple notepad app that actually looks like the original Windows notepad :D
## What makes it special?
- Takes up little space.
- No need to install.
- It has its own file type. (.dapps)
- You will get an update on it later.
- It's not that special.
> ATTENTION: The program may contain errors/bugs, these will be corrected later.
